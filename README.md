# FootbalData
A Jupyter Notebook about Football data analysis 

A data analysis and visualization, over some data with Names and other characteristics of Football players.
The data analysis is performed in Jupyter Notebook and uses the Python libraries pandas, seaborn and bokeh.

Pandas library is used to split the data into different dataframes, so more detailed analysis can further be performed.

Via the seaborn library, the chosen data from previously selected dataframe, is presented graphically, as dots on a screen.

Via the bokeh library, the data is futher more interactively represented, yet like dots on a graph, but can be hovered over
and each dot showing information about the player it represents. When the program is being run, this library creates new 
html page, where the interactive picture is presented.
